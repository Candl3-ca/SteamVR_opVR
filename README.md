A simple VR overlay that displays the battery of the controllers left

(attached to the left hand)

Also big thanks to @cnlohr for helping me with this :)

Gonna be working on implementing buttons for a VR keyboard and adding application and desktop preview

If you want to help out, please reach out to me! I'm fairly new to C & C++ but looking to learn! :>
